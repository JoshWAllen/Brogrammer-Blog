# Brogrammer Blog

A place to share wisdom with the boys about gym, coding, and life. [https://brogrammer-blog.vercel.app/](https://brogrammer-blog.vercel.app/)

## A Learning Experience

I created this simple blog for 2 reasons:

1. Firstly, to learn the fundamentals of NextJS13 including its new routing system with the `App/` folder and React server components.

2. The second, and more important reason, was to motivate the documentation of future projects by sharing findings with friends.

I hope to get the most basic MVP out by June 2023.
Stay Tuned!
